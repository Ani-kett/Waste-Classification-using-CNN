# Week-1
This project focuses on creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of plastic waste into categories such as PET, HDPE, or mixed waste. By leveraging labeled datasets, the model will aid in automated waste segregation, supporting efficient recycling and sustainable waste management practices.
